# Enable logging

If you want to enable script logging (optional), set the following environment variable.

```bash
export NDFC_LOGGING_CONFIG=$HOME/repos/ndfc-python/lib/ndfc_python/logging_config.json
```

This is a standard Pyton logging configuration file.  There is an example
file in this repository at ``lib/ndfc_python/logging_config.json``
